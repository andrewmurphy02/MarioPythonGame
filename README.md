# MarioPythonGame
This is my mario python game! Mario has the ability to move left and right as well as jump up and down. If you press the control key he will shoot fireballs. There are goombas that move left and right between pipes and if hit by a fireball they freeze, load the burning goomba image, and disapper a few seconds later.
